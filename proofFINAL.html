You look down to notice a cat sitting on the same bench as you. It's a black cat.

You take one last look at the pond. You look at the happy families, intact and whole. You wonder for a brief second what life is like for those kinds of families. Ones where tragedy hits them later in life or able to stay whole and happy. 

[[You leave to tell your family the news.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Thanks, cat." tags="" position="350,1150" size="100,100">You ride the bus in silence.

You think about your diagnosis and you feel shocked, but you also don't. You knew this was coming, have for a long time. It runs in the family. Your mother was diagnosed ten years ago. She turned into a chestnut brown horse with beautiful eyes.

Your family has a ranch for all your sick relatives. At least you'll get to see her again. 

A man sits in the disabled seats at the front of the bus and stares at you as he plays the saxaphone. 

You look out the window and think to yourself, [['man that is annoying'.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="'man that is annoying'." tags="" position="350,1275" size="100,100">You arrive to your sharehouse to find that no one is home.

What will you do?

[[Drink.]]
[[Watch TV.]]
[[Text your friends and let them know.]]
[[Sit on your phone.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Drink." tags="" position="325,1400" size="100,100">Well, it's not like you could destroy your body any further. You go to your fridge, grab the closest alcoholic drink, get cozy on the coach and take a big swig. You take one sip, and then another and then another. 

Soon, you find yourself looking at your coffee table to see empty bottles lingering everywhere. 

You have a good buzz going on. You feel sleepy. 

[[You fall asleep on the couch -&gt;Tuesday]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Watch TV." tags="" position="650,1400" size="100,100">There's no time like the present to watch some TV. 

You sit yourself down on the couch, snacks and drinks in hand, you turn on the TV. 

As you start to watch a show that is already half-way through, you can feel yourself settle into the couch. 

As you try to piece together the storyline of why the people on the screen are fighting, you think to yourself about how nice it is just sitting here and relaxing. The diagnosis isn't lost on you but it's nice to just sit and enjoy the quiet time you have. 

You watch late into the night before feeling the weight of exhaustion take you over. 

You soon feel yourself [[drifting off to sleep. -&gt;Tuesday]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Text your friends and let them know." tags="" position="200,1400" size="100,100">You plop yourself on the couch and with heavy hands text your friends the news.

[[Answer.]]
[[Decline.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Sit on your phone." tags="" position="500,1400" size="100,100">You sit on your phone. The TV blares in the background. You think you can hear the neighbours fighting through the walls. 

You spend the night scrolling through TikToks and Instagram. Maybe as a distraction, maybe because there was nothing else you wanted to do more.

You continue to scroll into the night and even move to the bed once you get the notification that your phone battery is low. 

Your eyes feel heavy and heavier as you get late into the night. You eventually [[fall asleep with your phone in your hand. -&gt;Tuesday]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Answer." tags="" position="75,1500" size="100,100">You decide to answer your friends calls, accepting the emotional toll it'll put on you. 

Message after message you answer all kinds of texts. Questions and proclamations of love come pouring out. You've cried. You've cried a lot.

You text early into the morning as you try to assure yourself and others that you are okay. 

Are you?

[[Yes. -&gt;Tuesday]]
[[No. -&gt;Tuesday]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Decline." tags="" position="200,1525" size="100,100">They try to call but you don't have the energy for that. You don't think you could handle the emotional turmoil that would happen if you answered all of them. You are glad they care but you think you'll explode.

You tell them that you just want some silence and to be left alone. They respect that. You can feel the pity come through the phone. 

[[You feel yourself fall asleep as you sit on the couch -&gt;Tuesday]], your phone still buzzing from all the messages.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Tuesday" tags="" position="700,1700" size="100,100">You feel yourself wake up. Your mind feels frazzled as you feel your mind wondering. 

You imagine yourself in the bright gold fields of wheat. You feel your shoulders pump and strain as you run through the field. You even feel your hoofs smash into the ground, dust flying as you roam. You even sense your mother riding beside you. 

You shake yourself out of your daze. 

You find the inexplicable need to [[go outside.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Opening Card" tags="Photo" position="600,750" size="100,100">&lt;span style="font-family: "Monoton", sans-serif; font-size: 48px;"&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="You leave to tell your family the news." tags="" position="1125,1225" size="100,100">Arriving at the suburban house you can feel it loom over you. The windows emit a bright yellow light as you wallk up the driveway. You hear the TV as you walk by the window. 

Dad would be watching the news right about now. Your sister would be doing something. You don't actually now for sure what that would be. 

You arrive at the front door. 

[[Walk in?]]
[[Change your mind and leave -&gt;Thanks, cat.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Walk in?" tags="" position="1150,1375" size="100,100">You open the door to a smell of what could only be a roast.

[[Hello?]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Hello?" tags="" position="1000,1400" size="100,100">The TV quietens as you also hear your sister rumaging in her room.

You hear a heavy load get off the coach and soon you see your dad enter from the loungeroom. He seems happy to see you. 

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")["Hey! When did you get here?" He laughs as you two embrace.]

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")["Just now." You respond.]

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")["Are you having dinner with us?"]

[[Sounds perfect.]]

Your sister doesn't take it well. 

Your father sits silently as he takes it all in. He sits in a stoic silence. 

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")[Your father speaks up first. "You could visit your mother if you wanted? I still go every Thursday. Same with your other family members. The ol' family ranch? Well, you'll get to visit before you turn anyway."]

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")["Yeah, okay dad." You respond. You don't know if you will or not. The family ranch is something all the kids feared  going to.]

Your sister embraces you as you three continue to talk late into the night. You talk about the life you had. The happy family memories you all have, even those including your mother. 

[[Go home. -&gt;Tuesday]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Sounds perfect." tags="" position="1075,1550" size="100,100">You try to hide your emotions as you withold your diagnosis from your family. 

It is an enjoyable dinner though. You feel like even though you didn't tell them what is going on with you the dinner felt cathartic in a way. 

It was a nice getaway from the diagnosis. Even if it was just for one night. 

After dinner you say goodbye to your father and your sister. You catch the bus and fall straight into your bed. You are exhausted and soon [[fall asleep -&gt;Tuesday]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="go outside." tags="" position="700,1825" size="100,100">You walk through the city and find yourself at the town centre. 

A fountain flows as you sit in the sunshine. Once again you find yourself staring at all the families and tourists go about their business. There's a fountain in the middle of the square. You see people making wishes by throwing coins into the clear waters. 

You stare for a long tome before you feel a nudge on your shoulder. You look over to see a mime standing over you. 

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")[['Yes?' You ask.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Tell him about your disease." tags="" position="275,2075" size="100,100">There's something about the sincerity of the mime that makes you spill your guts out.

You tell the mime about your diagnosis, about how long you have left and what the disease entails.

The mime looks at you and then puts a hand on your shoulder and pats sympathetically. 

He then sticks his arm out and proceeds to motion what you think is a needle into his arm. He then tilts his head at you questioningly. 

You think you understand that he is asking about a cure.

[[There's no point. There is no cure.]]
[[It's a nice thought. Maybe there is something I could do but there isn't enough time.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Refuse to tell the mime about your disease." tags="" position="850,2075" size="100,100">You try to tell the mime that you are fine. That everything will be okay.

You don't know how convincing you are or how good of an actor you are but regardless the mime doesn't seem convinced. 

He stares at you like a dog owner does when their puppy acts hurt.

[[Insist that you are okay.]]
[[Confess to not being okay. -&gt;Tell him about your disease.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Insist that you are okay." tags="" position="850,2200" size="100,100">You insist, telling the mime that you and everything is okay. 

Are you trying to convince the mime or yourself? Or are you truly okay?

Regardless, the mime backs off. Sensing the brickwall you have set up, decides that his energy is better spent somewhere else. 

He graciously gets off the bench and begins to scan the plaza, looking for someone else to terrorize. He finds a single mother with a screaming baby. 

Left alone, you stare at the fountain. Still, you continue to see poeple making wishes. You notice the time and need to get going but before you do...

[[Do you make a wish?]]
[[Leave without making a wish?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Do you make a wish?" tags="" position="850,2325" size="100,100">An idea comes into your mind as you stare at the fountain. You decide you want to make a wish. 

Standing in front of the fountain with a coin in your hand. 

You feel the cold metal sit in your hand. Your thumb twitching to flip the coin into the water. 

[[Wish for a cure?]]
[[Wish for something else?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Leave without making a wish?" tags="" position="1150,2100" size="100,100">You decide to leave without touching the idea of making a wish. 

Maybe you don't want to touch that side of the universe, maybe you don't even believe. 

You walk past the fountain as a couple kiss at the lip. They seem young, happy even. 

Did you experience love?

[[Yes.]]
[[No.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Wish for a cure?" tags="" position="775,2500" size="100,100">You decide to wish for a cure. The whole situation seems so hopeless, so fruitless. Why not ask the divine powers of the universe for a cure? 

Where's the harm in that? 

You stand at the lip of the fountain as you wonder if your mother was doing the same thing when she was diagnosed. 

You wonder if she would've made the same wish you did. You wonder what she was feeling when she heard the news. You were too young to remember when she was diagnosed, barely old enough for her to talk to you about it. 

[[Flip the coin.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Wish for something else?" tags="" position="950,2475" size="100,100">Maybe you've accepted your fate. Maybe you've given into the reality of your situation. 

Or maybe you just really want something else. 

What do you think you would wish for?

[[Love. -&gt;love]]
[[Happiness for your family.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Yes." tags="" position="1025,2225" size="100,100">Well, at least you got to experience that before you had to go. 

It's the small things that matter when you really think about it. 

You probably shouldn't think about that too much. You'll probably get too depressed. 

But if you were to make a wish, would you wish for a cure?

[[Yes. -&gt;a cure?]]
[[No. -&gt;No.Option1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="No.Option1" tags="" position="1200,2400" size="100,100">You are clearly not interested in the what-ifs of your situation. 

Maybe it's the cold hard reality of the situation that is making it easier for you. Maybe you just don't want to entertain the idea. 

You leave the fountain, the park and the mime, who, as you look, is terrorising a family with what you think are meant to be mimed air animals. 

Where do you want to go now? 

[[Dinner with the family.]]
[[Go somewhere else.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Go somewhere else." tags="" position="1575,2725" size="100,100">Having had enough of the park and wishes you decide that maybe your time is better spend somewhere else.

Where would you like to go?

[[The shops.]]
[[The bar.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="No." tags="" position="1275,2150" size="100,100">That's a shame.

But hey, it's overrated. In the end we all go alone anyway.

If you did make a wish, would you wish for [[love]] or [[a cure?]].

[[I wouldn't make a wish. -&gt;No.Option1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="love" tags="" position="1525,2525" size="100,100">There's no shame in that. You can still do it, you know. 

There is no shame in having hope that love will find you in the end. I can't judge. I'm just a figment of your imagination. A voice inside your dying brain. 

Did you want to make a wish now? Maybe there'll be someone pretty there while you make your wish?

[[Make the wish. -&gt;Flip the coin.]]
[[Still don't want to. -&gt;No.Option1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="a cure?" tags="" position="1525,2350" size="100,100">Who wouldn't want to wish for a cure? 

The thought croses your mind. It's tempting. What have you got to lose anyway? 

There is no loss in looking to beyond the veil at this time. There is no shame in anything that you are feeling right now. 

Did you want to make that wish now?

[[Still no. -&gt;No.Option1]] 
[[Yeah, I do. -&gt;Wish for a cure?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="Flip the coin." tags="" position="950,2700" size="100,100">The coin launches from your hand as you feel the pain in your thumb from flicking it too hard.

The coin arks before splashing loudly into the water. 

You watch it sink slowly as it wobbles through the water. 

It rests at the bottom, along with so many other coins. 

You wait and wait and //wait//. 

Soon you find yourself bored. Nothing happens.

[[You leave. -&gt;Dinner with the family.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Happiness for your family." tags="" position="1175,2700" size="100,100">You find yourself thinking about your family in this dark time. 

You remember the 'funerals' you had to have for all the family members that had turned due to the disease. Your family would always make a joke out of it not really being a funeral, but you remember how you felt at your mothers. As you stared at her dark brown eyes at the family ranch the day she had turned, you knew that even though she was technically your mother, she wasn't anymore. You patted her fur and to your surprise she felt so soft. You didn't know horses could be so soft.

You stared into her eyes for any kind of recognition but you didn't sense anything as she galloped off into the field with your aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins. 

Some part deep inside you wishes that you could just make sure your family is always happy. You can't wish for a cure but you can at least try to make sure that for as long as your family members are alive. 

[[Make the wish. -&gt;Flip the coin.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="There's no point. There is no cure." tags="" position="150,2200" size="100,100">You tell him that there is no cure for this disease. You list all the hospitals and universities that have tried for decades to help families like yours. 

You remember writing to all the politicians trying to get funding back on track to these institutions. 

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['I just don't want that kind of hope to begin with. It makes it hurt so much more if there's a chance.' You tell the mime.]

The mime shakes his head at you. He places his hand on your heart and then suddenly gives you a hug. 

He then leaves you to your thoughts. 

How do you interpret that?

[[It is him saying that there is always hope.]]
[[That it is love that is important, not hope.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="It's a nice thought. Maybe there is something I could do but there isn't enough time." tags="" position="500,2200" size="100,100">The mime looks at you and then at his watch. He shakes his head and places a hand on heart. 

He then leaves you alone to your thoughts. 

You scratch your head trying to figure out what he was talking about. 

[[Maybe he was saying that there is always time for those you love.]]
[[You honestly have no idea.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="It is him saying that there is always hope." tags="" position="75,2325" size="100,100">You've interepreted what you think the mime is trying to say. You think he was trying to tell you that there is always hope and that when hope is dead there is no chance for you. 

You don't know who this mime is but maybe it was a sign from above. 

You mull over this strange interaction when you notice the fountian once again. 

You see someone making a wish as they flick a coin into the water. 

Did you want to make a wish?

[[Yes. -&gt;Do you make a wish?]] 
[[No. -&gt;Go somewhere else.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="That it is love that is important, not hope." tags="" position="250,2425" size="100,100">You've interepreted what you think the mime is trying to say.

You stared into her eyes for any kind of recognition but you didn't sense anything as she galloped off into the field with your aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins. 

The one thing that you think kept your family together was love. Maybe that's all you really have at the end of the day. 

You see someone making a wish at the fountain. You see the shiny metal of a coin fling into the air and make a loud splash. 

Did you want to make a wish?

[[No. -&gt;Go somewhere else.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="You honestly have no idea." tags="" position="650,2200" size="100,100">You rack your brain trying to figure out what the hell the mime was trying to tell you. 

The more you try to unwrap it in your mind, the more you get confused. 

Your confusion leads your eyes to the fountain that has someone stands at the lip.

You see them make a wish as they flick a coin into the water.

You walk past designer shops as well as boutiques and vintage stores.

You even enter some.

It's not long before you realise that there is no point in you even buying anything. You won't even remember by tomorrow, so why bother?

You soon leave and catch a bus to your families house for the [[dinner party tonight -&gt;Go inside.]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="The bar." tags="" position="1625,3025" size="100,100">You feel that the day could be better spent at the bar. 

Having only to walk a few minutes up the road you find yourself at a pub. 

You place yourself on the bar and nurse the drink you got. 

You watch people come and go and in a blink of an eye, you find that you have been here for hours.

It's only then, do you realise that you have a [[dinner with your family. -&gt;Go inside.]]

You decide to catch the bus there. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="Dinner with the family." tags="" position="725,3000" size="100,100">Having had enough of the park and the wishes there, you decide that maybe you should spend your time better doing something else. 

You arrive at your father's house. 

Cars littered the street curb as well as the drive-way indicating that the rest of the family had already arrived. 

You decided that having only one full day left, maybe it would be best to have one dinner with the family. 

You can hear laughter and loud yelling come from inside.

[[Go inside.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="Go inside." tags="" position="725,3125" size="100,100">You enter the warm, brown glow and are immediately swarmed by little cousins and babies rushing through the hallway. 

You walk past them to get to the loungeroom where you see even more of your family sitting around. Drinks in one hand and nibbles in the other, it reimnds you of the countless times you had attended a family dinner like this. It was an unwritten rule to make sure the occassion wasn't one of sadness but rather a cheerful farewell. Like one would do for a friend moving away, rather than a wake.

You greet each family member that you can as you walk past them. Some tell you about how you were yay-high when they remember the last time that they saw you. 

Some even mention that they still see some of the horses at the ranch. They even mention that they will sneak in some extra carrots for you once you've turned. 

You don't know how you feel about that. 

[[You see your dad.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="You see your dad." tags="" position="725,3250" size="100,100">You see your dad talking to some family members as you walk into the kitchen area. He seems happy for the time being. 

You sister stands with some of the younger cousins as she entertains them. 

They both see you as you enter the room and both rush towards you. They hug you in a tight embrace.

You feel the warm embrace being sandwiched between the two of them. For that one moment, everything feels alright. You feel alright. 

Your dad hands you a beer and the three of you laugh into the night.

You try to stay up as late as possible but you find yourself incredibly tired. 

[[You fall asleep. -&gt;Wednesday]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="I think I'll watch the sunset, cat." tags="" position="600,1000" size="100,100">You sit with the cat in silence as you watch the sun set. You see families come and go as children play and eventually all then go home to dinner. You see the birds fly over you and over the horizon. 

You feel the tears well in your eyes and the weight in your stomach as what was a meditational moment has turned your thoughts dark as the illness looms in the corners of your mind. 

The cat takes you out of your thoughts however. As you look down at the cat, you get the idea that it has read your mind and without saying anything sits in your lap, curls up and purrs. You focus on its purrs rather than your thoughts. 

As it gets late, you thank the cat for helping you and you decide to [[get the bus -&gt;Thanks, cat.]] home. 

You watch the cat disappear into the dark as you wait at the stop. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="Wednesday" tags="" position="725,3400" size="100,100">You find your sleep once again plagued with horse thoughts. This one is slightly different. 

You found yourself once again in the golden fields. But you are not the only horse running. Beside you, you can see your mother running alongside you. She looks magnificent as she gallops. 

You wake up to find horse hair in your mouth. Your time is coming to a close, soon.

[[Get up.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="52" name="Get up." tags="" position="725,3550" size="100,100">You get up and get yourself ready for the day. 

You get dressed and make your way to the kitchen for breakfast. Everyone from last night's party are all long gone. Cups and food litter the rooms you walk past. 

Walking into the kitchen you see your father, already having breakfast. He is on his Ipad, reading something. 

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['Hey, kiddo. Did you want some?']

He points to his eggs.

[[Yes, please.]]
[[No, thank you.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="Yes, please." tags="" position="662.5,3675" size="100,100">(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['Alright.' You respond.]

He grunts as he gets up. He plates you some eggs with bacon and bread and places it infront of you. 

You eat. 

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['You know, your mother and I always had this dream to go to Italy together. Never did get to do it, never had the time.' He says.]

[[I'm sorry.]]
[[Would you ever go now?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="No, thank you." tags="" position="900,3675" size="100,100">You shake your head. You don't feel that hungry at the moment. 

Your dad shrugs as you take a seat next to him.

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['You know, your mother and I always had this dream to go to Italy together. Never did get to do it, never had the time.' He says.]

[[I'm sorry.]]
[[Would you ever go now?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="I'm sorry." tags="" position="450,3800" size="100,100">(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")[He waves you off. 'Don't be. While I didn't get to go to Italy, I did get to raise two beautiful children. There's not much more a man could ask for.']

He smiles at you as you take a bite out of your food. 

There's a moment of silence between you two before he speaks up again. 

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['I'm sorry this has happened to you kiddo. Your mother warned me about the disease but it's the funniest thing. You never think those kinds of things would happen to you. I truly am sorry.']

[[Finish your breakfast.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="56" name="Would you ever go now?" tags="" position="650,3800" size="100,100">(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")[He thinks for a second before responding. 'Maybe. If I could ever save enough money, but you konw how it is. With the ranch and the random expenses, there just never seems to be enough left over to save anything substantial.']

There's a pause.  

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['I'm sorry this has happened to you kiddo. Your mother warned me about the disease but it's the funniest thing. You never think those kinds of things would happen to you. I truly am sorry.']

[[Finish your breakfast.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="Finish your breakfast." tags="" position="550,3950" size="100,100">You finish your breakfast and decide to go for a walk along the park that's near your house. 

[[Go for a walk.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="58" name="Go for a walk." tags="" position="550,4075" size="100,100">You walk through the streets and suburbia to get to the park. 

You have lots of fond memories from this place. You remember the park plays you would have with your mother with your sister in tow. You would spend hours here together. 

You feel a kind of nostalgia here. It almost makes you feel sick with sadness as you remember the one and only time you and your sister tried to go to the park after your mother had turned. It didn't feel the same and it never did again. 

[[Walk along the path.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="59" name="Walk along the path." tags="" position="550,4225" size="100,100">You take a walk along the trees. The wind sings through the branches, kids laugh somewhere in the distance. The river washes through the park, near your path. 

It is there that you come across a group of crows blocking your path. 

[[Hello? -&gt;Crow blocking path.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="Crow blocking path." tags="" position="550,4350" size="100,100">(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['Hello' The lead crow croaks. //'Hello.'// The other crows say in unison.]

The crows stare at you with their black eyes. 

[[Hello? -&gt;Crow convo1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="61" name="Crow convo1" tags="" position="550,4475" size="100,100">(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['Your time is near.' It croaks. //'Time is near.'// The other crows follow.]

The noise from the park seem to fade away as the crows stare at you. It soon feels like it is only you and them in the whole world. 

[[It's not fair.]]
[[It's okay.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="62" name="It's not fair." tags="" position="450,4600" size="100,100">(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['Seldom life is. There were cards dealt to you even before you were born. This is the hand that you have been dealt.' //'Dealt.'//]

[[What if I wanted to achieve more?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="63" name="It's okay." tags="" position="650,4600" size="100,100">(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['I know it seems cold of me to say.

[[Will I have time to do more?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="64" name="What if I wanted to achieve more?" tags="" position="450,4725" size="100,100">(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['There are millions upon billion's of decisions you have made, could have made and couldn't have made.

[[....]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="65" name="...." tags="" position="450,4850" size="100,100">(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['All that is left is to accept the inevitable. You have had your time. No more no less. You may go quiet into that good night or you may not but regardless, your time is up.' //'Time is up.'//]

With that the crows squak and nip at each other before flying away. The rush of their feathers brings you back to the park. 

It's time to go [[back home]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="66" name="back home" tags="" position="550,5025" size="100,100">You end your little excursion to the park. The crows were right. Time is up and that was a stark reminder of how little time you have left.

Walking back to your home you can see that your dad and sister are getting the car ready for the trip to the family ranch. 

They see you and give you a wave. 

They get in the car. 

You won't be needing anything. [[Get in the car.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="67" name="Will I have time to do more?" tags="" position="650,4725" size="100,100">(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['No. Unfortunately, this is the amount of time you were given. No more, no less.' //'No more, no less.'//]

There is a pause before the lead crow squaks at you before flying upward. The swarm swirls around you, blocking the light before silence. It is then that you are left completely alone in the park. The sound comes back as the children still laugh in the background, the wind still sings, but something feels different. 

You know your time is up. 

It's time to go [[back home]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="68" name="Get in the car." tags="" position="550,5150" size="100,100">The car ride makes you feel like you're meant to be on just a normal family trip. 

Your sister plays her music. Your dad silently taps on the steering wheel while at the same time admonishing the songs. Stating that //'music was just better in my day.'// 

Your sister rolls her eyes as she scrolls on her phone. You watch both silently as you feel numb. It doesn't feel real that this is happening. And yet, it is. And there is nothing that you can do about it. 

[[Continue.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="69" name="Continue." tags="" position="550,5275" size="100,100">It takes hours but you try to soak in the last bits of your view. You try to appreciate the poetry of the landscape. The romanticism of the sun setting over the mountains. 

You try to take in as much detail of your dad's face as well as your sister's. 

There's an unspoken acknowledgement between you three as they understand what you are going through. Who knows how many times your dad has had to do this. 

At dusk, the three of you arrive at your family ranch. You see some horses grazing at the in the fields. 

The field looks exactly like the one in your dreams. You feel sick and woozy from the deja vu. 

Your dad parks in the dirt drive-way of the ranch. 

[[Exit the car.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="70" name="Exit the car." tags="" position="550,5400" size="100,100">You get out of the car and set your eyes on the ranch fully. You've only seen this place as a child so the details are hazy. Here you can see it with your adult eyes. 

The ranch is mainly two buildings. One is the rancher's home. A quaint country home with a veranda. Attached to it is the shed. The other building is the ranch. Two stories and made of wood. It's an American style ranch. 

You're interrupted by a middle-aged man walking out of the house and towards you and your family. 

First, he shakes the hand of your father and gives him a loving pat on the back. A kind of gesture that communicated that he felt sorry for your father for again having to drop off another family member. 

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['Heya mate. Got your call so I got a stall ready for you. Who is it this time?' The rancher asks.]

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['My eldest.' He replies as he points to you. He seems on the verge of tears]

The rancher looks at you and then reaches he hand out for you to shake. 

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['Well, hello.' He says. 'Don't worry about a thing. I have been looking after your family members for twenty years. I know all the ins and outs of looking after you and your family.']

[[Thanks.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="71" name="Thanks." tags="" position="550,5525" size="100,100">(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")[The rancher looks at your father. 'Turning tomorrow?']

Your dad nods. 

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['Ah, righto then.' He waves at you to follow him. 'Well, follow me then. I'll get you situated in the ranch. It'll be a nicer transition if you're placed in the right enviroment.']

It feels like the end for you. The sun sets even deeper into the earth. Everything is set with a purple glow. 

This is it. Your family cannot follow you where you are about to go. 

You hug your dad so tightly that you think you will break his bones. You lovingly pat your sister on the back as you two enbrace. She sobs into your shoulder. 

They promise that they will visit every week and bring treats just for you. You thank them for that but they don't realise that you won't even be able to tell. You will be a horse. You won't be able to think or appreciate the little things they do. 

[[Continue. -&gt;Ranch1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="72" name="Ranch1" tags="" position="550,5650" size="100,100">You feel like all choice has been taken from you as you follow the rancher towards the barn. You can hear the horses inside. All your family members in one place. 

The two of you arrive at the barn door.  

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")[The rancher opens the door. 'Well, this is you. I've got you in the last stall on the left. Make yourself at home and I'll see you tomorrow.']

The rancher leaves you with that.

[[Enter.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="73" name="Enter." tags="" position="550,5775" size="100,100">You enter the ranch and through all the neighs you hear you enter your stall. 

You seem to understand the neighs. Not on a language level but something beyond that. Something that can't be described through language. It was almost Lovecraftian in how unexplainable the connection is. 

You sit in the stall on a hay bed. Something that you think you will have to eat later. You don't remember which one is your mother but you get the impression she is somewhere in the room. 

[[Continue. -&gt;Ranch2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="74" name="Ranch2" tags="" position="550,5900" size="100,100">You try to sleep but you find yourself unable to.

You walk outside and into the starry night. From how far away you are from the city, you are able to see the Milky Way galaxy from here. 

For the last time you try to appreciate the things you know you won't be able to as a horse. 

You try to appreciate the beautiful chaos that is your mind. Wild and free.

You try to appreciate how you are able to make poetry about the world.

You try to soak in how you are able to see the beauty in the nature. 

You are going to miss your friends, your family and more importantly, yourself. 

It's only until the very early hours of the morning do you fall asleep.

[[Continue. -&gt;Ranch3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="75" name="Ranch3" tags="" position="550,6025" size="100,100">You awake. 

You find it uncomfortable to stand on all four legs. Your hooves almost feel like shoes. 

You're amazed that you are able to retain some of your thoughts. 

Maybe this won't be so bad after all. 

[[Continue. -&gt;Fields1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="76" name="Fields1" tags="" position="550,6150" size="100,100">The rancher comes out and puts a rope around your neck. He guides you as he talks to you.

He leads you to those fields you dreamed about so many times and now you are here. It almost seemed inevitable that you would end up here. 

There he takes the rope off and lets you be free. 

[[Continue. -&gt;Fields2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="77" name="Fields2" tags="" position="550,6275" size="100,100">It's only then that you notice something.

You feel your mind begin to feel hazy, foreign even. Those human thoughts you thought you had retained seem to almost slip away. They now seem so foreign to you, you can't even conceptualise what it is that you have lost. 

These thoughts and memories flow off your back like... like something. 

You try to grip at these memories but they disappear before you can even attempt to grab at them. 

You can feel you losing you. 

[[Continue. -&gt;Fields3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="78" name="Fields3" tags="" position="550,6400" size="100,100">All thoughts disappear from your mind. 

You don't think about anything. You don't even know what //you// means.

You stand in the field with some of the other horses. The wind rushes through your fur. It feels warm. 

You whip your tail at some flies on your back. 

The grass looks better in the field next to yours.

You decide to gallop there. 

[[Continue. -&gt;End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="79" name="End" tags="" position="550,6525" size="100,100">As you run, you notice another horse running beside you. 

An older female you think. 

She gallops close and you notice that she is a brown horse, with brown eyes. 

The two of you gallop together into the next field. 

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")[[Continue -&gt; ENDING]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="80" name="'Huh?'" tags="" position="600,500" size="100,100">(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['There are certain treatments we can do to make your life more pleasant. But the reality is that there is no cure for what you have-']

As the doctor tells you the news of your diagnosis you can't help but stare out the window. It's so beautiful outside. [[Too beautiful for news like this.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="81" name="'Yes?' You ask." tags="" position="700,1950" size="100,100">The mime looks shocked with indignation. A hand on his chest with fake outrage. 

He sits down on the bench next to you. He frowns and fake cries, he then points at you. 

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")['Yeah, that's me.']

The mime titles his head in a questioning matter. He's clearly asking why you feel this way. 

[[Tell him about your disease.]]
[[Refuse to tell the mime about your disease.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="82" name="Maybe he was saying that there is always time for those you love." tags="" position="500,2500" size="100,100">It's a nice thought. 

You mull it over a bit more and you realise that maybe you do need to hone in and focus on spending your time wisely. You only have so much time and you will need to realise what is important to yourself and what you want to achieve with the days that you have left. 

Its with that thought that you notice the fountain again. You see someone making a wish as they flick a coin into the water. 

Did you want to make a wish?

[[Yes. -&gt;Do you make a wish?]] 
[[No. -&gt;Go somewhere else.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="83" name=" ENDING" tags="Ending" position="550,6650" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
